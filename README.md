python-utils
=========

DISCLAIMER: This is a work in progress, and will probably continue to be so for a long time. Changes to the code will be made without notice, unless a notice is specifically requested. 

In my day to day work, I find myself reusing a lot of functionality. As such, this library will contain some methods that I think will help me write less redundant code, and focus on the new tasks I tackle. It will also be an exercise for me to write better python code, both stylistically and functionally. Feel free to use this as needed. This being said, let me know if you do use it. It always makes my day knowing that someone out there is benefiting from my code.
